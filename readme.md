Most config values are near the top and you can play with them. You'll want to keep an eye on volume and number of wallets and ensure it all seems "realistic" and by that I mean (within 365 days), not exceeding 1-2 billion daily volume, not exceeding a few million wallets, and generally doing a gut-check Garbage in == garbage out. This is basically more art than science.

Additionally, because this is meant to be a throw-away, one-off project, the code is hacky and there are occasional magic variables and so on. If you want to play with the macro behaviors, you may want to tinker with the Hype variables as they power the large spikes. To modify the micro, take a look at randomHolderFactory which contains some pre-configured behaviors. It should be relatively easy to mix-match or change these.

If you discover any fun trends or make any improvements definitely share with the community!
